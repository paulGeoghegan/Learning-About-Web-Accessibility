		<h2>An introduction to web accessibility</h2>
		<p>So what is web accessibility?</p>
		<p>Web accessibility means different things to different people but it's basically about making the web accessible to everyone and I don't just mean giving them access as in internet or a device but actually making it useable for them no matter whether they are deaf or if they have Dyslexia.</p>
		<p>I'm blind so I am going to talk about how to make the web accessible for other blind people.</p>
		<p>In order to use the web most blind people will use something called a screen reader, my favorite being NVDA. What this does is when you navigate around the screen using the arrow keys or by pressing tab it will read to you whatever you have selected. This allows us to use the web like most other people but there are a few things that you should include in your website in order to make sure that we can use it Effectively.</p>
