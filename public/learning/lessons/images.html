		<h1> Learning about accessibility with images </h1>
		<p> The image below has no alt text so someone using a screen reader wouldn't be able to tell what it is:</p>
		<img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/02/20/18/03/cat-2083492_1280.jpg" width="20%" height="20%" alt="Unlabeled">
		<p>This is equivilent to someone putting a blank image on a website and expecting you to know what it is:</p>
		<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WeyM8.jpg" width="20%" height="20%" alt="A black square">
		<p> Thats why it's important in order to add alt text you just have to have something like this inside your image tag: </p>
		<code>src="example.jpg" alt="This is an image"</code>
		<p>Now we can add some alt text to the original image</p>
		<img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/02/20/18/03/cat-2083492_1280.jpg" width="20%" height="20%" alt="A fluffy grey and white kitten sitting on a tree stump looking up while surrounded by trees">
		<p>Now when someone with a screen reader navigates to the image they would hear: A fluffy grey and white kitten sitting on a tree stump looking up while surrounded by trees</p>
		<p>It's that simple so make sure you remember why it's important</p>
